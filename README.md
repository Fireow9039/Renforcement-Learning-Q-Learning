Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning and SARSA

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms for reinforcement learning. These algorithms allow an agent to learn optimal policies by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards, and improving its decision-making over time.

Q-Learning is an off-policy algorithm where the agent learns the value of state-action pairs and takes actions that maximize future rewards, independent of the current policy.
SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy algorithm where the agent updates its Q-values based on the actions actually taken under the current policy.
Both algorithms are implemented and evaluated using a simple reinforcement learning environment to showcase their functionality and differences.

Features

Q-Learning Implementation: Off-policy learning, where the agent learns by selecting the best action (greedy approach) to maximize future rewards.
SARSA Implementation: On-policy learning, where the agent updates Q-values based on the action it takes according to its current policy.
Environment: The notebook uses OpenAI's Gym or a custom environment for training the agent.
Visualization: The results of training (e.g., learning curve, reward per episode) are visualized for better analysis.
Comparison: A comparison between Q-Learning and SARSA to highlight the differences in performance and learning behavior.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
OpenAI Gym (for environment simulation)
NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas (for numerical operations and visualization)
You can install the required dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Getting Started

Clone the Repository:
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/RLQlearning_Sarsa.git](https://github.com/Fireow9039/Renforcement-Learning-Q-Learning/blob/main/RLQlearning_Sarsa.ipynb)
cd RLQlearning_Sarsa
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the RLQlearning_Sarsa.ipynb file:

jupyter notebook
Explore and Train:
In the notebook, you will find sections explaining the Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms, along with code for training the agent and visualizing the learning process. You can experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, etc.) and see how the agent's performance changes.
